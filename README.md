# Road-Construction
Prediction Model to conclude where to construct a new road.

The ability to predict the final result of construction projects based on limited initial input data could be a very valuable tool for every project manager and/or construction enterprise.
India is a country with the second largest road network in the world. Out of the total stretch of 5.4 million km of the road network, almost 97,991 km is covered by national highways.
Keeping in mind the scale at which road infrastructure is required to grow; a prior analysis on where new roads should be paved will hugely reduce the pre-planning time and logistics required.
 
This project will help analyze traffic intensity and flow; enabling us to predict where to construct new roads resulting in reduced traffic overload, lower travel time, and sustainable infrastructure.
